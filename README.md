Animated-Menu
=============

Easily configurable animated menu.

This menu app has 2 different animation options. The first option has all the buttons animating simultaneously, and the second options has the buttons animating consecutively.

The buttons are positioned anywhere in the view and hidden to start with. When the menu button is pushed, the buttons all move to the centre, and are then animated to their original positions. It is easy to add and remove buttons, as they are all hooked up via an IBOutletCollection. The order that they are taken in is based on the tag value of the button. Their positions are also easily changed by just dragging them to wherever you want them to be!

This sample application was made for a presentation on animation for the iPhone at the iOSKW meet up: http://www.meetup.com/iOSKitchenerWaterloo/
